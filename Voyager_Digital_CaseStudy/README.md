# New Frontiers with Voyager Digital
### By Erik Larson

During the 1990’s, the internet matured with the development of visionary businesses that could see their potential and prosper through this new medium of exchange and connection into the homes of people across the United States.  Most of today’s juggernauts of technology, such as Amazon, Google, Linux, and Salesforce, were born into this decade and quickly learned to run and take advantage of all of the benefits to be found in this web of community and exchange of ideas and services.  One of the trends on the cutting edge was the way in which brokerages worked with people.  Traditionally, people with wealth would work with individuals known as brokers that they could call and ask for advice on the market and use for trading stocks for them.  Some brokerage companies on the cutting edge of this trend realized that they could now work directly with individuals through the internet, effectively cutting out the need for a stockbroker as a middleman and providing stock insights and market knowledge to a greater audience than before.  Among these cutting-edge stock brokerage companies was E*Trade.  E*Trade recognized the possibilities and used the internet to provide market knowledge and affordable trades directly to the consumer.  In the last 20 years this space has grown exponentially through the use of cellphones.  People no longer even need a desktop.  Instead most everyone in the world carries a mobile computer, connected to the internet through their cellphones.  And the latest trend of online brokerages like Robinhood and WeBull have successfully navigated that domain.

Today, we are at the tipping point of a new technological revolution.  A revolution based on an older technology, known as blockchain, being applied in new and innovative ways.  Today there are many new blockchain communities and financial ecosystems being created to exploit the superpowers blockchain provides.  The beauty of blockchain is the ability to track events and transactions in a secure, immutable way.  Many competing blockchain ecosystems (like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, and Cardano) are racing to solve new opportunities unlocked by blockchain technology.  This includes projects like proving ownership of art, verifiable doctorates and degrees, digital identities for voting, verifying sources of consumer products, and even monetary transactions and finance.  One byproduct of these startup blockchain ecosystems are what are known as crypto currencies.  A common philosophy is the desire to decentralize power so that no one person or organization can corrupt the data on the ecosystems being built.  In order to do this, the protocol of the technology used in these blockchain ecosystems produces digital “coins”.  These coins in essence are like holding stock in a company where you literally own a fraction of that company.  Only in cryptocurrencies they may not only give you skin in the game but they also may have other perks like a say in the governance or future of that blockchain.  So the desire to harm a blockchain would be self-defeating.  The one downside to this is that while it is an exciting space and many may want to get involved and own their share of these competing “startups”, many of these blockchain ecosystems are disconnected from each other and it is hard for the common person to get past the technological hurdles required to own a cryptocurrency.  Not only that but then to participate in the governance of these blockchains through activities like staking require even more technological knowledge and understanding.  This dilemma is where the newest type of online brokerages are forming.  Brokerages like Coinbase, Voyager Digital, Gemini, and BlockFi.  Recognizing this, Voyager Digital’s CEO, Steve Ehrlich said, 

> “[We wanted a product] that really simplifies the markets but gives the consumer enough information that they can make a really good decision on which crypto-assets 
> they want to hold, earn and invest in and trade over the near future. That’s how we >came together, and we started building the product off of a few meetings.”

Steve Ehrlich recognizes the importance of bridging gaps between consumers and the products they want.  That pioneering online brokerage, E-Trade, we mentioned earlier was once led by Steve Ehrlich as VP for Brokerage from 1999 to 2006 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenehrlich/).  In an interview with Executive America, Steve Ehrlich said, 

> “We want all the retail consumers to use our platform. I’m ex E\*TRADE, I was there in the days when E\*TRADE first grew up and started bringing online brokerage to the 
> masses; we want to bring crypto to the masses.”

In 2018, Voyager Digital broke into the crypto-asset brokerage scene through what is known as a reverse IPO.  Reverse IPO’s, also known as a reverse merger, are often used by private companies that take control of dormant public companies as an expedient and cost-efficient way to go public (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/reverse-merger-ipo.asp">Investopedia Why Do a Reverse Merger Instead of an IPO</a>).  As a result, the New York-based broker was publicly listed on the Canadian stock exchange, TSX Venture Exchange.  Although Voyager Digital isn’t the oldest crypto-brokerage, it was the first to go public.  According to an interview with YouTube influencer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w_XVpRLI_A&t=1707s">“MeetKevin”</a>, Steve sees this as a big advantage over their competitors.  He sees this as a huge trust builder with their account holders and the industry.  Being a publicly traded company means that everything is transparent and not only do they have to be transparent with their balance sheet but they also have to do their due diligence when working with other large companies in the crypto-industry.  It is also an advantage in their ability to interact with customers as they can also be shareholders of the company.

When compared to their competitors there are really two types of competitors the more traditional mobile stock brokerages like Robinhood and WeBull and the crypto brokerages like Coinbase, Gemini, and BlockFi.  The main biggest differentiator between companies like Robinhood and WeBull compared to Voyager Digital is that they are just dipping their toe in the water only offering about 5 or 6 of the oldest cryptocurrencies out there like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin Cash.  However, as Steve points out in his interview with “MeetKevin” that’s like telling people they can only invest in 5 companies out of the Fortune 500.  Voyager Digital offers an impressive 58 coins on their platform for investing, a number that even beats all of their crypto brokerage competitors.  Not only that but they offer commission-free trades and interest on over 20 coins, again beating all their crypto brokerage competitors.  Another unique characteristic of Voyager Digital is their own digital currency.  Owning this provides interest to the holders and can provide extra perks like increased interest on other crypto-assets and stablecoins.  Also, Voyager Digital was the only public company until Coinbase’s Direct Public Listing earlier this year.  All of these work toward Voyager Digital’s advantage.  Stock ownership, interest on crypto assets, voyager coin perks, and an easy mobile trading interface are all sticky touchpoints with their customers that keep them engaged and unlikely to move their coins to other exchanges.  They have seen explosive growth this year and are likely to continue.

According to their last quarterly statement, <a href="https://www.sedar.com/DisplayCompanyDocuments.do?lang=EN&issuerNo=00005648">“Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the Three and Nine Months Ended March 21, 2021”</a>, Total Revenue for the first quarter of 2021, ending March 31, 2021, was about $60.4 million.  This is an increase of 21,326% over the same time period last year.  Net Deposits for the first 3 months of 2021 was $1,258,565,122, a 16,805% increase over the same period last year.  Finally, the number of verified accounts for the 3 months ending March 31, 2021 was 1,007,641 accounts, an increase of 1,192% over the same period in 2020.

Despite the monstrous growth, Voyager Digital continues to raise capital.  In January 2021, the company closed a private placement offering of common stock for gross proceeds of about $46 million and in February they closed another private placement of common stock for another $100 million.

Voyager Digital also has an exciting roadmap ahead of them.  According to an interview with YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc5mooQ6Npo">“Digital Asset News”</a>, they are planning to provide Credit Card and Debit Cards and a new Desktop experience to clients before the end of this year.  Then in the near future they also plan to expand to equities trading as well.  While this may seem ambitious, Steve Ehrlich, a number of his company execs and board members all came from E*Trade and the stock brokerage space.  This is a team of experienced and innovative leaders in the financial brokerage space.  

#### Voyager Digital’s co-founders include:
    
- Steve Ehrlich who is CEO of Voyager Digital, and former VP Brokerage at E*Trade, and CEO at Lightspeed Financial
- Philip Eytan who was formerly from Morgan Stanley and Cerberus Captial
- Gaspard De Dreuzy who was Co-founder of fintechs Kapitall and Trade.it
- Oscar Salazar who was former architect and founding CTO at Uber

It is hard to provide any critique to a company like Voyager Digital.  They are at the cutting edge of this space, providing a clean and easy user interface that is welcoming to the lay person.  They also have a solid roadmap to be the all-in-one trading platform for investors that want both crypto asset and equity exposure.  However, this can be a double-edged sword.  My biggest concern would revolve around what seems to be growing pains.  The first 3 months of 2021 saw explosive growth for this company and it seems their systems and backend seemed to have trouble keeping up.  As an account holder myself, I noticed that transfers of money into their brokerage took exceptionally long.  Transferring dollars from my bank account to their account took over 2 weeks to clear.  Also, I know of some people I referred to this company that tried to get an account and sat on a waiting list for 3 weeks.  Obviously, I don’t know the exact reasoning for this but I have heard complaints from others.  It seems that their systems were not prepared for the onslaught of interest they received.  This likely cost them many would-be clients and potentially millions more in Net Deposits.  I only hope that they have fixed their services to be robust enough to scale with demand in the future.
